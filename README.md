To practice using classes, states and props in React while building a useful tool during my job search

## v2 Final Thoughts
First time setting up a backend and making real fetch requests. I used a great online tutorial and was exposed to React Context for the first time. Everything went OK until introducing the global context variable and maintaining a good understanding for how the data was being parsed from the server and how individual components would react to the global state changes.

I ultimately decided to rewrite the app from scratch allowing me to grasp the concepts of setting up the MongoDB backend as well as approaching the front end component design knowing I would eventually be introducing the global context variable

## v1 Final Thoughts

I managed to get a good bit of this to work through my own testing and research. I am planning to revisit to all new work experience and education components to be created and finally I will have it render a nice ouput...perhaps a PDF like Michael Osman does in his example!?
