# CV Project

To practice using classes, states and props in React while building a useful tool during my job search

## v3.1 Final Thoughts
Final version fully working. I now have a fairly good understanding of how the MongoDB server is communicating with my Express middleware app and how that middleware is integrated with my frontend. Added an 'UPDATE' route and am fairly happy with the site as it is.

Updates:
- UPDATE route added
- Global context variable fully implemented and updating components appropriately
- Authorization added

Updates and Features to come:
- Error handling - 50% complete
- CSS facelift - 80% complete
- Ability to save CV as PDF
- Ability to print CV

## v2 Final Thoughts
First time setting up a backend and making real fetch requests. I used a great online tutorial and was exposed to React Context for the first time. Everything went OK until introducing the global context variable and maintaining a good understanding for how the data was being parsed from the server and how individual components would react to the global state changes.

I ultimately decided to rewrite the app from scratch allowing me to grasp the concepts of setting up the MongoDB backend as well as approaching the front end component design knowing I would eventually be introducing the global context variable

## v1 Final Thoughts

I managed to get a good bit of this to work through my own testing and research. I am planning to revisit to all new work experience and education components to be created and finally I will have it render a nice ouput...perhaps a PDF like Michael Osman does in his example!?
